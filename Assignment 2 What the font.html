       <br> I've created a monster
       <br> 'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
       <br> Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
       <br> A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
       <br> Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
       <br> Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
       <br> By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
       <br>  When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey!)
       <br> You waited this long, now stop debating
       <br> 'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
       <br> I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
       <br> But your husband's heart problem's complicating
       <br> So the FCC won't let me be
       <br> Or let me be me, so let me see
       <br> They tried to shut me down on MTV
       <br> But it feels so empty without me
       <br> So come on and dip, bum on your lips
       <br> Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
       <br> And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
       <br>  I just settled all my lawsuits Fuck you, Debbie!

        <br> Now, this looks like a job for me
        <br> So everybody, just <br>
        <span>follow me</span>
        <br> 'Cause we need a little controversy
        <br> 'Cause it feels so empty without me

        <br> Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
        <br> Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
        <br> They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
        <br> 'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!"
        <br> A visionary, vision is scary
        <br> Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
        <br> A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
        <br> In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
        <br> And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
        <br> For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
        <br> Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
        <br> Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
        <br> Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
        <br> The center of attention, back for the winter
        <br> I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
        <br> Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
        <br> Testing, "Attention, please"
        <br> Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
        <br> Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
        <br> A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

        <br> A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
        <br> Anybody who's talkin', "This shit, that shit"
        <br> Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
        <br> Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
        <br> And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
        <br> You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
        <br> You don't know me, you're too old, let go
        <br> It's over, nobody listens to techno
        <br> Now, let's go, just give me the signal
        <br> I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
        <br> I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
        <br> Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
        <br> But, sometimes, the shit just seems
        <br> Everybody only wants to discuss me
        <br> So this must mean I'm disgusting
        <br> But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
        <br> Though I'm not the first king of controversy
        <br> I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
        <br> To do Black music so selfishly
        <br> And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
        <br> There's a concept that works
        <br> Twenty million other white rappers emerge
        <br> But no matter how many fish in the sea
        <br> It'd be so empty without me
